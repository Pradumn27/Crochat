CROCHAT is a chatting application for friends....
Here I plan to implement a central platform for daily use where you can text,video call,screenshare with all your friends.

How to setup the environment:
1)Install Node for your computer If not previously installed.
2)Fork this repository on your machine
3)cd in the repository you've stored the project
4)run npm init
5)run npm start
